\f0\fs24 \cf0 ## GDP Data Analysis\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 This project general concept is similar to problem idea #2. We have a dataset of countries\
(separated by their respective GDP\'92s). We would like to know how the GDP\
between countries varies across the world. More specifically, we want to know, "Which 5\
countries have the largest GDP, and which 5 countries have the smallest GDP? And what\
are the gaps for these top and bottom 5 countries? What is the spread of GDP in those\
two groups? In addition, we want to find the 5 countries that have the largest GDP\
growth, and which 5 countries have the smallest GDP growth? And how do they\
compare? The analysis may also include plot(s) comparing the top and bottom 5\
countries. GDP is defined in terms of total monetary value of all goods and services produced\
and sold by a country}
