## GDP Data Analysis

This project general concept is similar to problem idea #2. We have a dataset of countries
(separated by their respective GDP\'92s). We would like to know how the GDP
between countries varies across the world. More specifically, we want to know, "Which 5
countries have the largest GDP, and which 5 countries have the smallest GDP? And what
are the gaps for these top and bottom 5 countries? What is the spread of GDP in those
two groups? In addition, we want to find the 5 countries that have the largest GDP
growth, and which 5 countries have the smallest GDP growth? And how do they
compare? The analysis may also include plot(s) comparing the top and bottom 5
countries. GDP is defined in terms of total monetary value of all goods and services produced
and sold by a country
